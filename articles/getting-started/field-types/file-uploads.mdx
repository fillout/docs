### **Size limitations**

On the **Free, Starter,** and **Pro** plans, individual file uploads can be `up to 20 MB per file` and there is no restriction on total files uploaded, as long as usage is within our [fair use policy](https://www.notion.so/Fair-use-policy-c9d8da191f4e43209521134fe0c65f27?pvs=21). On the **Business** plan, file uploads can be `up to 1 GB per file`. All plans allow unlimited file uploads.

## Restrict file types and number of files

Click the field type followed by its `settings icon` to open the right-hand panel . Here you can restrict the number of files your respondents can upload.

You can also restrict uploads to certain file types under the **Advanced** section, like PDF, mp4, png, and other types.

## Viewing uploaded files

You can view uploaded files from any submission on the Fillout [results tab](https://www.notion.so/Results-e59927a7827a4b01baf91a2d8d0afb59?pvs=21).

If you prefer, integrate your form with [Dropbox](https://www.notion.so/Sync-file-uploads-to-Dropbox-with-a-form-5df1cfe8e23d4c0b8d2f977e1e33e663?pvs=21) or [Google Drive](https://www.notion.so/Upload-files-to-Google-Drive-with-a-form-1f5d4726fd494f1b81616f580054beb2?pvs=21) to send all file uploads to a specific directory in Dropbox/Google Drive.
