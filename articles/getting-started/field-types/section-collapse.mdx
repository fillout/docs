This field is often used to group together questions if you have many questions in your form. Simply drag the `Section collapse` field onto your form.

You can also enable `Is collapsable` to allow the user to open or close a particular section. Click the field followed by the `settings icon` to toggle the switch on the right-hand panel.

## Conditionally hide many questions at once

If you set [conditional hiding](https://www.notion.so/Conditionally-hide-fields-dc375019d2cc42b18b96f9280c607f21?pvs=21) logic on a section, all the questions in that section will be shown/hidden based on that logic.
