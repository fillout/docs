## How to add an ending page

An **ending page** is added by default when you create a new form. You can add more ending pages by clicking `+ Add page` followed by `Ending`.

  **Tip:** Use [page logic](https://www.notion.so/Page-logic-82c7a7c7c8174289b27f841f5869743d?pvs=21) to send different users to different ending pages.
</Tip>

## **Ending page types**

In the left-hand panel, there are three types of ending pages you can choose from: **Page**, **New form** and **Redirect**.

### **Page (default)**

The default **ending page** thanks respondents for submitting a form. Users can customize the thank-you text, add images, banners, and other fields to display upon submission via the left-hand panel or by clicking and highlighting the text.

### **New form**

This **ending** type lets users redirect respondents to another form and can optionally pass URL parameters, such as carrying over the respondent's name to the next form. See [here](https://www.notion.so/Combine-and-repeat-forms-82087013ecd940788a50a28ac10b51e5?pvs=21) for more information.

### **Redirect**

This redirects users to another link like your homepage or portal after form submission, skipping the default Fillout ending page.

## Ask respondents to fill out your form again

Respondents can fill out your form multiple times. Simply add a `Fill again` button from the left-hand panel. More details [here](https://www.notion.so/Fill-again-button-f90d87eba10e4fbbaa9c4d1233300f2e?pvs=21).

Click or drag and drop the `URL button` in the left-hand panel. Then, click the `settings icon` to open the right-hand panel, and customize it as you see fit.
