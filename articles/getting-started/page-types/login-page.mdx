## Login page types

In the left-hand panel, you can choose between **Email**, **Password**, and **Single Sign-On (SSO)**.

### Email login

This is the defaultÂ **Verification type**, which requires respondents to enter an email and verify it with a code sent to their inbox.

You can also `Restrict domains` to allow only specific email domains. For instance, you can limit access to emails ending with @[yourcompany.com](http://yourcompany.com).

**Limit respondents to one form submission**

Prevent respondents from submitting your form multiple times by toggling the `Limit to one submission` switch under **Limit submissions**.

**Use databases to restrict logins**

If your form is integrated to a database like Airtable, you can limit logins to respondents listed in that database and retrieve their records for use in the form. In the left-hand panel, under **Integration**, toggle the `Connect to database`switch and select your **Base**, **Users table**, and **User email field**.

### **Password login**

Change the **Verification type** to `Password` and enter your preferred single passcode. You can edit this later on.

Remember to `Publish` your form after entering or changing the password, otherwise respondents will not be able to access your form.

### Single Sign-On login (SSO)

You can also opt for `SSO`. Add Microsoft, OneLogin, Google Workspaces, Okta and other types of SSO login to your form. Learn more [here](https://www.notion.so/Single-sign-on-SSO-form-login-22274833f0e045d390c62811187e2e6d?pvs=21).

## Allow respondents to edit past submissions

Some forms may need to be updated or edited after submitting them. Under **Basics** in the left-hand panel, toggle the `Can edit existing responses`.
