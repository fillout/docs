## Add a scheduling page to your form

Click `+ Add page` and choose `Scheduling`.

Choose your scheduler. Fillout has its own [native scheduler](https://www.notion.so/Fillout-Scheduling-1db9da8398be4a2dbbb23511765ced97?pvs=21) supported by Google Calendar, and currently supports [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) and [Cal.com](https://cal.com/). If you prefer to use another scheduler, you can [request it here](https://forms.fillout.com/t/c85QiJrD7Vus).

### Fillout Scheduling

Select `Scheduling` to grant Fillout access to your Google, Zoom, or Teams calendar. Check out this [guide](https://www.notion.so/Getting-Started-With-Fillout-Scheduling-3e791227fa5e42569cca3cde632b2fe9?pvs=21) to learn more. Then, select a meeting type.

### **Calendly setup**

`Connect to Calendly` and grant Fillout access. In the **event dropdown**, choose the Calendly event that you’d like your users to book.

### [Cal.com](http://cal.com/) setup

For `Cal.com`, copy and paste the link of your scheduling event. You can provide either the unique event or the full scheduling link.

That’s it\! Go to `Preview` mode to try it out. You can always change which event your **scheduling page** is linked to in the right-hand panel by clicking the `settings icon`.

On the **Fillout** **results** page, you’ll see a **direct link** to the new scheduling event, tied to every submission.

## Pre-fill information

You can pass in information to the Scheduling question type using **Calendly/Cal.com prefills** in the right-hand panel. Click the `settings icon` to make the panel appear.

This is useful if you’ve already asked your respondent for their email or name, or if you’d like to pre-fill the calendar to a particular date.

Click the `+` symbol to **add reference**. This lets you select the value you would like to reference. In this example, we'll pre-fill their email.

## Save the booked time to an integration

With **Fillout**, you can save the exact time your respondent booked and the scheduling event UUID to any integration, like [Airtable](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-an-Airtable-form-016c5cbe122d4739bc34eb3deda81846?pvs=21) or [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Update-existing-Notion-pages-with-a-form-a0449bf94f6f4d3c9d39107190f3f0a2?pvs=21).

Go to the **Integrate** tab. Under **Mappings**, click `+ Add new`. Choose which **Airtable field** you’d like to save the booked event time to. Then, choose the **scheduling** input as the mapped field.

You can click `Continue` on the Scheduling question if you’d like to reference the booked event’s **end time** (as opposed to just the **start time**) or the **Calendly/Cal.com event UUID**.
