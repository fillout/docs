One of the most important parts of connecting to a database is connecting your form fields to actually be sent to your database when the form is submitted.

## How to map fields

### 1. Connect a database

Head to **Integrate** and connect your form to [Airtable](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-an-Airtable-form-016c5cbe122d4739bc34eb3deda81846?pvs=21), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-Notion-form-19d937988136410197c059b30afcfa0c?pvs=21), [HubSpot](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-HubSpot-form-436c18b12bd948819995e711f548c44d?pvs=21), or [other databases](https://www.notion.so/Integrations-ff23eebebba04d728aecd4744d814b81?pvs=21).

### 2. Drag and drop synced columns

Go back to **Edit** in the top menu. In the left-hand panel, you'll see columns from your database automatically synced. Drag and drop these to your form.

## Mappings

You might want to send additional information to Airtable, Notion or other databases when a respondent submits your form, other than your form fields. For example, you might want to save:

- [URL parameters](https://www.notion.so/URL-Parameters-Hidden-fields-f11c3b56de8e4c7d9cccf47825ccf3c4?pvs=21)
- [Static values](https://www.notion.so/Write-a-static-value-to-an-integration-8a1dcb55fb2a4d0a9e0a9d019ad25e93?pvs=21)
- Submission date
- [Fields from the record returned after logging in](https://www.notion.so/Login-page-7c96895e91714b839a6556712f1bc49e?pvs=21)
- [Fields from a pre-fetched record](https://www.notion.so/Pre-fetch-dynamic-data-for-your-form-dbd94e6dcfc84cb1aea746cbebb04895?pvs=21)

You can create a field, [pre-fill](https://www.notion.so/Pre-fill-fields-d10c479c53c24d0e8f6922cf6bbf785c?pvs=21) it with a value, and connect it to Airtable or Notion through the **Connected** menu in the right-hand panel.

**Mappings** in the **Integrate** page also lets you do this directly. For example, let's connect a URL parameter. `+ Add new`and pick a field in Airtable, and then any referenceable value in **Fillout**\!
