## Overview

Create a free scheduling form that streamlines appointment booking process and sends all event details directly to `Airtable`. This guide explains how to set up a scheduling form, connect it to Google Calendar and integrate it with your Airtable bases.

## How to set up

### 1. Create a free Scheduling Form

[Create a Scheduling Form](https://build.fillout.com/new/scheduling) or add a [scheduling page](https://www.notion.so/Scheduling-page-9413d4ccba0c49e0a811a4270b7469f4?pvs=21) to an existing Fillout form. You’ll be prompted to connect your Google Calendar and optionally connect Zoom or Google Meet, as a meeting location.

### 3. Choose where to send booking details

In the **Mappings** section, select `Schedule` (or the name of your Scheduling page) and map which Airtable fields you’d like to send booking details to.

You can map the following fields, directly to Airtable:

- Invitee Email
- Event Start Time
- Event End Time
- Event URL
- Full name
- Meeting notes
- Phone (if provided)
