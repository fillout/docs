## How it works

### 1. Switch your form to update mode

First, choose `Airtable` on the **Integrate** tab.

Then specify that you want to `Update record`.

## 2. Use a formula to specify the record to update

You'll now get a formula that defines a **unique link** for every record in your table.

Create a new `formula` field and copy the formula Fillout provides on the **Integrate** page.

## 3. Preview your form

That's it\! `Finish setup`. Try out your form in `Preview` mode, or click one of your unique links to update a record after you’ve published your form\!

Your form is **automatically pre-filled** for whichever record it is updating. This can be changed in the top left area.

<Note>
  **Note:** If you don’t provide an **id** in the unique URL, the form will create a new record instead.
</Note>

## Let users choose a record to update

Use [this approach](https://www.notion.so/Choose-a-record-to-update-eb677830903b4d2e82450b77230313a2?pvs=21) if you prefer to let users choose (in Fillout) which record they’d like to update.

## Advanced next steps (optional)

You can use update forms in combination with products like Airtable interfaces, Softr, or Stacker. For example, instead of adding a formula in Step 2 above, we could add a `Button` field.

Then, we can display this button in an Airtable interface, for users to easily edit the record.
