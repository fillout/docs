## Create new linked records with a subform

If you want the respondent to choose how many linked records they would like to create, enable `Can create new records` on the linked record picker. More details [here](https://www.notion.so/Create-new-linked-records-in-an-Airtable-form-3ac9271be92a4a8c90b375e13b4fb109?pvs=21).

You can **fully customize** the sub-form that appears for adding the linked records.

## Combine multiple forms together

You can combine multiple **Fillout** forms into one form using this [feature](https://www.notion.so/Combine-and-repeat-forms-82087013ecd940788a50a28ac10b51e5?pvs=21). Your respondents wonâ€™t know they are filling out multiple forms. You can pass information between forms using URL parameters.

For organizational purposes, you can organize your forms together on the home page using [workspaces](https://www.notion.so/Workspaces-8402e03e82b04f6bb8bc157542639ae1?pvs=21).

## Repeat a form

Let users choose to restart the form with a `Fill again` button or automatically redirect the user to the start of the form using the `URL button`. Both are found in the **Ending** page on the left-hand panel. More details [here](https://www.notion.so/Combine-and-repeat-forms-82087013ecd940788a50a28ac10b51e5?pvs=21).

## Use the Webhook integration (Advanced)

You can always use the [Webhook](https://www.notion.so/Send-form-submissions-to-a-webhook-d46ed5018d5044f6a4ae19acb4df6524?pvs=21) integration to connect to Make or Zapier to create multiple records. We recommend using the other approaches, since those are easier to setup.
