Alternatively, you may create a `Form`, and add a `Payment` page in it. See [this guide](https://www.fillout.com/help/payment-page) for more information.

### 2. Edit the product details

Click `Edit product`, and change the details as you see fit.

You can also click the blue `+` icon to reference a selection field in your form where you asked customers to pick a product.

<Tip>
  **Tip:** You can toggle the test mode switch on the upper right side of your Stripe account to preview the payment form without needing to make a payment.
</Tip>

### 4. Connect the form to an Airtable

Go to **Integrate** in the top menu and click `Airtable`. Next, connect to your Airtable account and choose a [base and table](/016c5cbe122d4739bc34eb3deda81846?pvs=25#0249a46d7b524466a0fe3ef89a14c05b).

### 5. Map Airtable columns to form payment fields

Under **Mappings**, click `+ Add new`. Then, click `Pick reference` to check the payment fields. Go to your Airtable base, and create one column per payment field.
