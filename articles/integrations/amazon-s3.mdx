## What is Amazon S3

[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable cloud storage solution provided by AWS, designed to store and retrieve any amount of data with high availability and security. Ideal for businesses and developers, S3 offers cost-effective, reliable data storage for applications, backups, and content distribution, making it a top choice for cloud storage needs.

## How it works

### 1. Link your Fillout form to Amazon S3

Go to **Integrate**, and click `S3`. If you donâ€™t already have an access key to AWS, you can create one under `Security Credentials`. More details [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey).
