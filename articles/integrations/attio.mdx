## What Attio is

[**Attio**](https://attio.com/?ref=fillout) is a CRM platform that adapts to different business needs, effectively managing sales, customer relationships, and data. It stands out for its ease of use, strong data integration, and focus on security.

## How it works

### 1. Link your Fillout form to Attio

Open the Fillout form you want to connect with Attio, then go to **Integrate** in the top menu. Click `Attio` to link your form to an object.

Enter a `Name` for your Attio connection, and click `Connect to Attio`. You will be prompted to grant access to a workspace of your choice.

Lastly, select an **Object** you’d like to sync form responses to.

<Note>
  **Note:** You can connect your Attio form to any object in your workspace.

### 2. Map your form fields on **Fillout**

You can map your Fillout fields to your Attio attributes either by dragging them from the left-hand side when editing your form.

Alternatively, you can click `Edit` on your Attio connection in the **Integrate** page and do **Mappings** there. `+ Add new` and match the fields in your Fillout form to the corresponding attributes in your Attio object.

Select the Attio attributes in the left dropdown and map it to the relevant Fillout field or question in the right dropwdown.

<Tip>
  **Tip:** You can click the **refresh** icon on the right side to have the most recent changes reflect in **Mappings**.
</Tip>

### 3. Publish and share

`Publish` your form. Now, answers to matched fields will appear in the attributes of your record on Attio.

## Updating existing records

If you’d like to update existing records that already exist, just toggle `Update if record already exists?`. Then choose which attribute you’d like to use to determine the record to update.
