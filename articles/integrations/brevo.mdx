## What Brevo is

[Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/) (formerly Sendinblue) is an all-in-one marketing platform that helps businesses manage their email marketing, SMS campaigns, and customer relationship management (CRM) in one place.

## How it works

### **1. Connect your Fillout form to Brevo**

Open an existing form or create a new one. Head over to **Integrate** and look for `Brevo`.

Type your **API Key**. To view the instructions, click the link in banner. Then, select a **List** to `Continue`.

### **2. Link your form fields in Fillout**

First, select the `Email address` field. Then, `+ Add new` fields to map the corresponding **Contact fields** in Brevo to those in your form.

Click `Finish setup` once everything is set.

### **3. Publish and share your form**

That’s it\! Click `Publish` in the upper right corner to share your link or embed it on your website. Now, every time someone submits your form, a new contact will be added to your chosen list. If an email already exists, the contact details will be updated.

<Note>
  **Note:** If a respondent inputs a new email but uses a phone number that’s already on your list, Brevo will show an error.
</Note>

## **Specify a condition**

You can choose to run your integration only when a certain condition is met. Check out the quick guide [here](https://www.notion.so/Conditional-integration-logic-180148986f5d47b981b5de5580b00169?pvs=21).
