## What is Discord

[Discord](https://discord.com/) is a communication platform designed for creating communities, where users can chat via text, voice, and video, often organized around specific topics or interests.

## How it works

### 1. Connect your form to Discord

Open your form or create a new one in Fillout. Go to **Integrate** tab from the top menu and look for `Discord`. Sign in with your Discord account to `Authorize` access.

Choose a server from the dropdown menu to `Continue`.

### 2. Select a channel

Choose a channel to send messages to and your preferred message formatting. `Finish setup` to test your form and `Publish` it.

### **Send all fields (recommended)**

By default, form submissions are summarized and sent to your channel.

### **Custom message**

You can tailor the default message to display only selected fields. Simply click the `+` icon on the right side or type `@`, then choose the specific field.

That's it\! Now every time your form is submitted, youâ€™ll get a notification on your chosen Discord channel.
