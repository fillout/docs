## How to add a company

After [connecting your Fillout form to HubSpot](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-a-HubSpot-form-436c18b12bd948819995e711f548c44d?pvs=21), `+ Add new` under **Create company**. Choose a **Company property** from the left dropdown and reference it to the relevant field in your form.

  **Good to know:** You can map URL or Email fields to the **Company Domain** property, and it will extract the domain name. For example, [alfie@sola.com](mailto:alfie@sola.com) will be recorded as [sola.com](http://sola.com) in HubSpot.
