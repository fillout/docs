## What Intercom is

[Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) is a customer communication platform that integrates various messaging services to facilitate business-to-customer interactions. It allows companies to manage support, sales, and marketing communications through live chat, bots, and personalized messaging.

## How it works

### **1. Link your Fillout form to Intercom**

Open the form you want to `Integrate` with Intercom. Then, enter an **account name** to connect.

### **2. Map your form fields**

Match the fields in your Fillout form to the corresponding fields in Intercom for the new message. Make sure to include the contact's email and the message content.

You can optionally also choose to create new leads or users if they donâ€™t exist with the email in question, and associate answers in the form to the user.

### **3. Publish and share**

Once everything is set, click `Finish setup` on the upper right corner. New form submissions will now create new messages, and optionally new leads/users directly in your Intercom\!

Remember to click `Publish` after making any further changes to the integration.

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](https://www.notion.so/Conditional-integration-logic-180148986f5d47b981b5de5580b00169?pvs=21).
