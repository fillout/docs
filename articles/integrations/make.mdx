## What is Make

[**Make**](https://www.make.com/) (formerly Integromat) is a robust platform that lets you create and automate a wide range of tasks and processes called **Scenarios**, spanning from individual tasks and workflows to integrating various apps and systems seamlessly.

**Scenarios** start with a **Trigger**, an app where your information comes from, and which causes a series of predefined **Actions** to occur in other apps, where your data gets sent automatically.

## How it works

### 1. Create a scenario

Log in to your [Make account](https://www.make.com/register) or create a new account. Then, `+ Create a new scenario`.

Click `+` to select a trigger and search for **Fillout** to watch new responses.
