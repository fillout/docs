## How it works

### 1. Switch your form to update mode

First, choose `Notion` in the **Integrate** page.

Then specify that you want to `Update page`.

### 2. Use a formula to specify the page to update

You'll now get a formula in Fillout that defines a **unique link** for every page in your table. Create a new `formula`property in Notion and copy the formula provided by Fillout.

Adding a formula property is mostly for your convenience. If you already know the page ID of the page that you want to update, you can pass it into the URL yourself\!

<Note>
  **Note:** If you don’t provide an **id** in the unique URL, the form will create a new page instead.
</Note>

### 3. Preview your form

That's it\! Click `Finish setup`. Preview your form or use a unique link to update a page. The form auto-fills for the page it's updating, and you can select the **Record to update** in the top left.

<Note>
  **Note:** In Notion, the formulas with the links to update the records are most easily clickable when using a Table view.
