## What is Notion

[**Notion**](https://www.notion.so/) is one of the most popular all-in-one productivity and collaboration tools. Itâ€™s a flexible workspace for teams and individuals to create and organize notes, documents, databases, and task lists.

## How it works

### 1. Create your database in Notion

<Note>
  **Note:** If you already have your database created in Notion, you can skip this step.
</Note>

Create aÂ [Notion page](https://www.notion.com/help/create-your-first-page)Â and typeÂ `/database`. Name your database and add a column for each question. Set the property type (e.g., Text, Select, Multi-select) and, if using Select or Multi-select, enter the answer options.

### 2. Create your form in Fillout

In your [Fillout dashboard](https://www.notion.so/Fillout-com-9070fc1c2b1a4f5db75d9e29affbeb81?pvs=21), click `+ Make a Fillout` followed by `Connect` and choose Notion.

Choose your theme (donâ€™t worry, you can always change this later). Then, enter your **Account name** and `Connect to Notion`.

<Note>
  **Note:** If you have multiple Notion workspaces, ensure you're connecting to the right one. Switch workspaces from the top right of the popup.
</Note>

`Select pages` youâ€™d like to allow Fillout access to. You can add and remove pages to this integration anytime in your Fillout dashboard.

<Note>
  **Troubleshooting:** Donâ€™t see your database in the dropdown list? Check you have connected to the correct workspace and granted access to the page where your database is.
</Note>

### 3. Map your questions

Your `Notion Columns` now appear in the left sidebar of your Fillout form editor. Simply drag & drop to start building your form.

To connect a new question to your Notion database, or check an existing connection, click the `settings icon` of a field to open the right sidebar. Click **Connected**. You can also add content to the body of a Notion page. See this [help article](https://www.notion.so/Add-content-to-a-Notion-page-with-a-form-685f81e741c44fb0b40d733117a897fa?pvs=21).

<Tip>
  **Tip:** If you make changes in your Notion database that you want to reflect in your Fillout form, hit the Refresh Notion Connection icon ðŸ”„.
</Tip>

### 4. Publish & Share

Once youâ€™ve finished creating your form, youâ€™re ready to go\! Simply `Publish` and share. Form responses will now automatically populate inside your Notion database.

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](https://www.notion.so/Conditional-integration-logic-180148986f5d47b981b5de5580b00169?pvs=21).

  **Good to know:** Fillout has many powerful features like [**branching**](https://www.fillout.com/help/page-logic) and [conditional hide/appear logic](https://www.fillout.com/help/conditional-hiding). No matter how complex your needs are, thereâ€™s a way to build it in Fillout.
