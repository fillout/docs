## How it works

### 1. Create an autofill PDF or document

Open the form you would like to link with a PDF or document and head over to the **Integrate** tab. Look for `Generate PDF`.

Drag and drop your PDF or document file. You can **generate multiple documents** if needed.

### 2. Map fields to your document

If your PDF has recognizable form fields, Fillout will automatically detect them and add fields to the document, in amber color. If not, click `+ Add field` and drag/resize fields as necessary wherever you would like to insert text on your PDF.

Choose any **field** to open the right-hand panel and choose the appropriate **Connected fields**.

You can also change the **Font settings** used for respondent input.

For **Choice** fields or questions, click `+ Add option` to insert multiple fields corresponding to each possible form option.

### 3. Preview and publish your document

Click `Preview` to generate a document using your mappings and the latest submission from your form. Once youâ€™re happy with the result, click `Publish` in the upper right corner to finalize the document.

### 4. Set up your preferred workflow

Now that your document mappings are configured, there are several ways to use your generated document.

By default, every time a new form submission is received, you can download the latest document in the **Results** tab. Look for the **Generated documents** column.

## Send autofilled PDFs to respondents

Go to your form's **Settings**, and turn on the `Respondent notifications` switch. Next, toggle the switch to `Attach generated documents or PDFs`. Alternatively, you can also do this with [custom emails](https://www.notion.so/Respondent-notification-email-b63d309e89e7465b91b195a44ccf2788?pvs=21) as well.

## **Upload filled PDFs to 3rd party apps**

You can upload generated documents to 3rd party apps, like Airtable, Notion, SmartSuite, GoogleSheets, Dropbox, and more. Connect your form to your preferred app under **Integrate**.

In your integration **Mappings**, map a file upload field (from your 3rd party app) to the appropriate `Document` you created.

When you receive a submission, you will see an **integration link** in your form's **Results** page that will take you to the uploaded file in your chosen app.

## Let users download the PDF upon form completion

Lastly, you can add a `Download PDF` button from the left-hand panel to any [ending page](https://www.notion.so/Ending-page-c472321e634e4ac5bd3b08104407619b?pvs=21) to let your respondents download the generated document once they complete a form.
