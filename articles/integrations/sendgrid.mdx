## What SendGrid is

[**SendGrid**](https://sendgrid.com/) is a service that helps websites and apps send emails to their users. It is handy for businesses and developers who want a reliable way to send emails, like signup confirmations or newsletters, to their users.

## How it works

### 1. Link your Fillout form to SendGrid

Open your form. Go to **Integrate** and click `SendGrid`.

Enter your **API Key** in Fillout. You can find this in the **Settings** section of your SendGrid dashboard. `Create API Key` on the upper right corner. Enter a **name**, then go with the default `Full Access` permission.

### 2. Choose a template

If you don’t have a template in SendGrid yet, select `Email API` on the left-hand panel followed by `Dynamic Templates`.

Click `Add Version` and start with a **blank template** or choose a **SendGrid Email Design**. Customize your email template as you see fit.

### 3. Map your form fields on **Fillout**

Match the fields in your Fillout form to the corresponding fields in your SendGrid contacts. For example, link the email address to its respective field. Then, fill out the **Sender identity** section.

You can personalize emails, by inserting dynamic data under **Template variables**. For example, we want the name to change depending on the customer’s name. Once everything is set, click `Finish setup` on the upper right corner.

### 4. Publish and share.

Once you’ve finished creating your form, you’re ready to go\! Simply `Publish` and share the link. Respondents will now receive the email template.

## **Add or update contact information**

Skip sending an email and simply `Add or update contact`. Choose a **List** in your SendGrid account. Then, link the **Email address** and `+ Add new` **Contact fields** as you see fit. Map the SendGrid fields on the left to their respective Fillout fields on the right.

## **Specify a condition**

If necessary, you can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Click [here](https://www.notion.so/Conditional-integration-logic-180148986f5d47b981b5de5580b00169?pvs=21) to learn how to.

## Personalize your email

You can use **handlebars** to [pipe a respondent's information](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/using-handlebars) in the notification email. For example, we'll personalize the email by adding the respondent's name. Simply type `{{ name }}` anywhere on your email.
