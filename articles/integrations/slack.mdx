## What is Slack

[**Slack**](https://slack.com/) is a communication platform designed for teams to collaborate and work together more effectively. It offers messaging, file sharing, and other features to help teams stay connected and productive.

## How it works

### **1. Link your Fillout form to Slack**

Open your form in Fillout and head to the **Integrate** tab, then click `Slack`.

Choose a unique name for your Slack integration and click `Connect to Slack`. The name you choose doesn’t matter, it’s just for identifying which Slack workspace you connected to in case you reuse the connection on other forms.

### 2. Enter the channel name

Type the name of the channel from your workspace you want to send notifications to, e.g. #random or #general.

That's it\! You will now receive notifications on the Slack channel whenever a respondent completes your form.

### Send all fields to Slack (recommended)

Choose the first option, `Send all fields`, to get form responses in a nicely formatted message in your channel. You’ll see responses like this in Slack:

<Tip>
  **Tip**: We recommend this option, since Fillout handles ordering the questions properly and you won’t need to make changes if you add more questions to your form.
</Tip>

### Send a custom message to Slack

Choose the second option, `Custom message`, if you want to specify the exact information that gets sent to Slack. Press the `+` plus button or type `@` to reference questions in your form.

<Tip>
  **Tip**: You can format Slack messages using [Slack’s formatting markdown language](https://slack.com/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages).

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](https://www.notion.so/Conditional-integration-logic-180148986f5d47b981b5de5580b00169?pvs=21).
