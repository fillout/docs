## What SmartSuite is

[**SmartSuite**](https://www.smartsuite.com/about-us) is a team-oriented work management platform that empowers groups to organize, monitor, and oversee workflows, projects, and daily assignments efficiently. It provides a centralized solution for planning and overseeing all your team's tasks and projects.

## How it works

### 1. Connect to your SmartSuite account

Head to the **Integrate** tab from the top menu, and select `SmartSuite`.

Input your SmartSuite **API key** and **Workspace ID**. You can find your **API key** in your user profile, and your **workspace ID** as the first 8 characters after https://app.smartsuite.com when you’re logged in.
