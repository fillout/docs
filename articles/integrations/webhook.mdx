## What is a webhook

A **webhook** is a way for one system (like **Fillout**) to send real-time data to another system (like the 3rd party tools you use) as soon as an event occurs. Under the hood, a webhook is an **HTTP callback** and can be a GET, PUT, POST or DELETE request.

## Connect your form to a webhook

### 1. **Link your Fillout form to** a webhook

Go to **Integrate**, and click `Webhook`.

Enter your **Webhook URL**, and `Test` it. When you're good with it, click `Finish setup`.

### 2. Publish and share your form

Thats it\! You have all you need to configure a webhook when the form submits. `Publish` it and share the link.

## Available webhook options

Toggle the `Advanced view` switch to set up your webhook with any of the parameters or arguments you need.
