## How to choose a layout

On your form, click `Theme`.

![Ply1 Web](/images/ply1.webp)

In the **Form designer**, go to **Position**, and select your preferred layout.

![Ply2 Web](/images/ply2.webp)

<Note>
  **Note:** Your chosen layout will be automatically applied to the rest of the pages. Currently, only the cover page supports having a different layout to the rest of the form.
</Note>

You can choose between the following layouts:

- **Clean** - no image, but background color can be changed
- **Right** - text on the right \+ image on the left
- **Left** - text on the left \+ image on the right
- **Under** - text under a cover image
- **Through** - text through image
- **Over** - text in a container on top of the image

<Note>
  **Note:** For full page image, generally 16:9 is best or 1280 x 720. For side-by-side layouts, 512 x 720 is the ideal size, however you can use any size because the positioning can be [adjusted](https://www.notion.so/Add-images-or-GIFs-b9b9d12276d842d68983d4d843ef50c7?pvs=21).

## How to add animated page transitions to your form

Certain positions come with subtle animations out of the box. Click `Preview` to try out your form. Youâ€™ll see automatic animations between pages, depending on which form position you chose.
