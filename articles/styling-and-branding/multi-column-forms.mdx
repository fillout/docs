## Overview

Multi-column forms can be a great way to save space and make your form look more organized. Instead of having all your questions listed in a long, single column, you can split them up into **multiple columns**. This is especially useful if you have a lot of questions or a limited amount of space on your form.

## How to add another column

`Drag a question` to the right of another question. You can also reorder columns with drag and drop.

<Note>
  **Note:** Some question types are not supported by multi-column layouts yet such as, Address, PDF viewer, Section collapse, Video, Button, Date time picker, Picture choice, Calendly and Payment. Contact [support@fillout.com](mailto:support@fillout.com) if you have a use case that requires one of these to be side by side.
</Note>

Most questions have a `Half width` option in the right panel to shorten the input box. Click the settings icon to open it.

## Add three columns or more

You can choose the `Table` field in the left-hand panel to add a third, fourth, and additional columns. More info [here](https://www.notion.so/Add-a-table-to-your-form-16f0ee47667b80fea998deb465a6b515?pvs=21).
