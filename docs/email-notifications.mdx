That's it\! `Publish` and share your form. You'll now receive an email each time someone submits your form.

## Enable i**ntegration error notifications**

Sometimes, third-party integrations can have unexpected errors when using them. For example, their service was down, or took too long to respond. Fillout will always still save the responses for those forms, and it can also send you an email with the error that occurred\!

From the **home page**, click your `Account name` at the bottom left corner followed by `Settings & Members`.

Then, go to **General** and toggle `Enable integration alert notifications?` to enter your email. Be sure to `Save changes`.
