## **Collect a dynamic type of currency**

If you'd like to let your respondents choose the currency type or if the currency type should be specified by an [external source](https://www.notion.so/Integrations-ff23eebebba04d728aecd4744d814b81?pvs=21) (e.g. Airtable or Notion), use the `+` button to reference a prior field from that integration source.

For example, here we reference the currency dropdown to make the dropdown determine the currency type.

## **Convert currencies**

Enable the `Convert currency` toggle in the right-hand panel to automatically convert the currency the respondent types in. You can specify a fixed currency to convert it to or provide it dynamically using the `+` button.
