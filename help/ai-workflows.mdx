## How to use AI

Go to the **Workflows** page and click `+ Blank workflow`. Choose which form you’d like to **apply the workflow to** in the dropdown menu. Then, select a [trigger](/help) followed by an `AI action`.

## Types of AI actions

Choose between the four types of **Actions** below:

**Summarize text**

Get a summary of the form submission or a specific set of answers by clicking `Custom` and referencing fields. Click the `+` icon or type `@`.

**Classify text**

Automatically select the category that best matches the form response from several options you provide under **Classifications**.

**Generate text**

Create a custom text based on provided instructions, such as drafting an email or writing a message.

**Extract information**

Easily get only the information you prefer to know by referencing a specific **Text to extract info from**. Click the `+` icon or type `@` to choose a field or question. Input the information you’re looking for in the **Outputs** field.

Once you’re all set, `Test` your form, then `Publish` it.

### Pre-made AI templates

You can choose an [AI template](https://build.fillout.com/home/workflows) in a single click. These are common use cases for Fillout Workflows.
