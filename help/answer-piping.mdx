## Overview

Make your Fillout forms more dynamic with **answer piping**, which inserts a respondent's previous answers into later questions or text fields for a more personalized and interactive experience.

For example, you can create references to:

- Previous form inputs
- [URL parameters](/help/url-parameters)
- Dates (e.g. today, a month from now, etc.)
- [Dynamic data from integrations](/help/fetch-dynamic-data)
- [Calculations and variables](/help/calculations)

## **Referencing in field labels**

To reference previous form inputs in plain text in the form, type `@` in a form field to show the reference menu.

Select the field or question, or simply search for it. Test your form by clicking `Preview` in the upper right corner.

<Note>
 You can only reference fields on the current page or on previous form pages.

## **Referencing in field logic**

To base **show/hide logic** for fields on previous form inputs, click its `settings` icon to open the right-hand panel. Under **Logic**, `Set conditional logic`. Click [here](/help/conditional-hiding) for more details.
