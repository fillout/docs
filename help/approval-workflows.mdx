## How to automate approvals

On your Fillout dashboard, navigate to **Workflows** in the top menu, and select a template under **Approvals**.

</Frame>

Choose to **Approve or reject** form submissions or **Assign task**.

`Create workflow` and choose the form youâ€™d like to automate. Alternatively, you may open an existing form and do the same in the **Integrate** page.

### Approve or reject submissions

By default, the form owner is the **Approver**. You can `Edit` this to choose another member of the workspace or add more approvers.

You can also opt to **Request approval by** `Slack DM` or `Slack channel` other than through `Email`. If necessary, add **options** like escalate or follow up, request for **Approver input** like reason and comments, and edit the default **Notification email**.

A different email will be sent depending on the option the approver will choose. You can opt to `Edit` the [contents of each email](/help/custom-emails) and [format its style](/help/custom-emails). When you have set your workflow, `Test` this before clicking `Publish`.

## Assign task for submissions

Delegate a task to your team after receiving submissions. The default workflow template, sends a summary of form responses in a Slack channel to notify members.

Besides notifying, you can enhance this workflow. For example, add a step for reviewing submissions. Customize it by clicking `Edit` in **Approval** and adding **Options**.

You can opt to edit the `Custom message` in Slack and reference form fields. More info [here](/help/scheduling-workflows#8494c5d4aadf4c6ea9b768bde8a8b494).

## Manage approvals in one dashboard

When you receive an approval request, it will redirect to the **Results** page of your form where you can take the necessary `Action needed`.

You can view comments by clicking the `messaging icon` beside **Answers**.
