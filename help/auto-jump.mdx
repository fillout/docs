By default, when respondents finish answering a page, they have to click a button to go to the next page. With **auto jump**, the respondent is automatically redirected to the next page after making a selection, without having to click a button.

  **Important:** Respondents still need to click the **submit** button at the last form page to complete the form.

## How to enable auto jump

Go to your form's **Settings**, then click `Form Behavior` on the left side. Toggle `Auto-jump to the next page`.

<Note>
 This works for form pages with a single question. The following fields are supported: Dropdown, Multiple choice, Picture choice, Opinion scale, and Star rating.
</Note>

That's it! `Publish` your form. Now, respondents will no longer need to click a button to proceed to the next page.

### Hide buttons

You can also create forms without buttons if you want respondents to focus only on answering. Click the `button` followed by the `settings icon` to open the right panel. Under **Logic**, toggle `Hide always`.

  **Important:** You still need to make the button at the last page visible so that respondents can submit your form.
