## Automatically redirect to any form

Go to your form's **[Ending](/help/ending-page)** [page](/help/ending-page) and choose the `New form` on the left-hand panel. Then, select the new form you want to redirect users to in the drop-down.

## Pass data between forms with URL parameters

First, make sure you've registered the allowed URL parameters in the form you are sending users to. Details [here](/help/url-parameters). Go to **Settings** followed by `URL parameters`.

Next, `Set URL parameters` through the left side of the form and map fields.

That's it! Make sure to `Publish` both forms when you're ready to go live.

## **Let users re-submit a form**

Go to your form's **Ending**, and drag and drop a `Fill again` button from the left side.

By default, the form will restart from the first step. Enable the `Start from page` switch in the right side to choose a specific page to restart from.
