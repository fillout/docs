## What is conditional logic

**Conditional** **[logic](/help)** allows you to make forms that adapt to a respondent's answers. Fillout lets you `Set conditional logic` based on:

- Previous form inputs
- URL parameters
- Calculations
- Quiz scores

## How to specify a condition

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the integration">
    Head to **Integrate** and click your existing **connection**.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/logic/image-1.png" alt="Screenshot of the Integrate tab of a form" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set a condition">
    At the bottom, click the `condition symbol`.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/logic/image-2.png" alt="Screenshot of the Integrate tab of a form" />
    </Frame>
      In this example, we'll only add contacts to our [Klaviyo](/help/klaviyo) newsletter if they will attend the movie screening. Click `+ Add condition`. Choose the field or question followed by the relevant option.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/logic/image-3.png" alt="Screenshot of the Integrate tab of a form" />
    </Frame>
    That's it! Now, newsletters will only be sent to those who will attend the screening. Note that you can do this for any integration type, like [Airtable](/help/airtable), [HubSpot](/help/hubspot) and [many more](/help/integrations).
