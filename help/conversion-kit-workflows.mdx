## How to automate form abandonment prevention

Click **Workflows** from the top menu of your Fillout dashboard and choose between the **Conversion kit** workflow templates. Alternatively, you can create a new form or open an existing form, and click **Integrate** in the top menu.

You can either **Send email if form abandoned** or **Send Slack message if form abandoned**. `Create workflow` then choose the existing form you’d like to apply it to.

## Send email if form abandoned

Follow up with leads who haven’t completed your form yet. By default, email reminders are sent 30 minutes after a respondent exits a [partially completed form](/help/partial-submissions). Set your preferred time period by clicking `Edit` under **Form abandoned**.

This reminder is automatically sent to the email address inputted by your respondents in the form so make sure to include an email field.

You can also add attachments under **Advanced** and edit the style and content of your message when you click `Email` in the upper section of the pop-up. More info [here](/help/custom-emails).

## Send Slack message if form abandoned

You can let your team members know when a respondent doesn’t complete a form. Notifications are sent 30 minutes after a form is abandoned by default. To change this, click `Edit` under **Form abandoned** and put your preferred time period.

Connect your **Slack** account by clicking `Edit`, then choose your preferred **Channel** to send the alert to. You can also choose `Custom message` to tailor how the notification will look. Check out this [quick guide](/help/slack).

Make sure to `Test` your workflow through the upper right corner, and `Publish` your form when everything’s set.
