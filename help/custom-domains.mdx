## What is a custom domain

A **custom domain** is a unique web address to replace your web form's default URL, enhancing brand visibility and trust. It adds professionalism, improves SEO, and ensures a seamless user experience.

Alternatively, you can go to your account **Settings** from the homepage and click `Custom domains`. Enter a **subdomain** like [forms.mydomainname.com](http://forms.mydomainname.com) or [surveys.mydomainname.com](http://surveys.mydomainname.com).
