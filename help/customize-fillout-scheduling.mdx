</Frame>

To make [advanced customizations](/help/advanced-designer), scroll down in the left-hand panel to open the `Advanced designer`.

## Edit form link

Click the **Share** tab of your form followed by **Customize link** to `Edit link`. You can also **Change share preview** here and add an [image and/or description](/help/custom-link).

Paid Fillout accounts can also [add a custom domain](/help/custom-domains) for fully branded scheduling forms.

## Change your avatar

Simply hover over the `avatar` in your form to customize it. Alternatively, you may do so in the [booking page](/help/how-to-create-scheduling-form#1590ee47667b80718a29f72c05c84a8d).

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/scheduling/image-17.png" />
