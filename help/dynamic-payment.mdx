## How to make your payment page dynamic

First, open an existing form or create a new one. Next, click `Logic` on the bottom right corner to add your **Calculations**. Check out this [quick guide](/help/calculations#9969fe70824745d4bd3b8ca72efcf0af).

Then, go to your form’s **[Payment](/help/payment-page)** [page](/help/payment-page) or make one if you haven’t yet. Add `Your product here` and its description if you prefer.

Under **Product name**, type `@` or click the `+` icon, then select the question or field where you ask customers to choose products or services.

Do the same for the **Price**, but this time, click `Calculations` to select the appropriate field.

`Preview` your form through the upper right corner to test it, then `Publish` and share the link or embed on your website. That’s it! Now, every time someone places an order, the **Product name** and **Price** will change depending on their choices.
