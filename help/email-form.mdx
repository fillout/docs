Click `Set recipients` to enter the **email addresses** of the people whom you would like to send it to. You can also customize the **Message** and [format the style](/help/custom-emails#c6872760d8cb46d382efc4089b770e9a) of the email.

Here, you can also enable `Reminders` and set your preferred **Frequency**.

<Check>
**Good to know:** You can add up to 100 email addresses. If you need to add more, email [support@fillout.com](mailto:support@fillout.com)
</Check>
## Track submissions

In the same pop-up window, click `Track responses`. Alternatively, you can go back to the **Share** page to do this. Here, you'll see if a recipient has **Not started**, is **In progress**, or has **Completed** your form.

## Automate form sends with Zapier

You can [create a](/help/zapier) **[Zap](/help/zapier)** to automate emailing forms. After connecting the necessary apps, select a **Trigger**.

In this example, when a user cancels their subscription in Stripe, we'll send a Fillout form, which would be the **Action**. Click `Publish` when everythingâ€™s set.

That's it! Any user who cancels will automatically receive the Fillout form.
