## How to choose a layout

On your form, click `Theme`.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/ply1.webp" alt="Screenshot of the Form designer tab of a form" />
</Frame>

In the **Form designer**, go to **Position**, and select your preferred layout.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/ply2.webp" alt="Screenshot of the Form designer tab of a form" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Your chosen layout will be automatically applied to the rest of the pages. Currently, only the cover page supports having a different layout to the rest of the form.
</Note>

You can choose between the following layouts:

- **Clean** - no image, but background color can be changed
- **Right** - text on the right \+ image on the left
- **Left** - text on the left \+ image on the right
- **Under** - text under a cover image
- **Through** - text through image
- **Over** - text in a container on top of the image

<Note>
  For full page image, generally 16:9 is best or 1280 x 720. For side-by-side layouts, 512 x 720 is the ideal size, however you can use any size because the positioning can be [adjusted](/help/image-gif).

## How to add animated page transitions to your form

Certain positions come with subtle animations out of the box. Click `Preview` to try out your form. Youâ€™ll see automatic animations between pages, depending on which form position you chose.
