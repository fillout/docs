## How it works

When you create an account, you set up your own **organization** to create various forms. You can invite others to join as [collaborators](/help/invite-collaborators) and control their access to specific workspaces with [granular permissions](/help/invite-collaborators).

## How to create another organization

On the lower right corner, click your **account name** followed by **Switch organization**.
