## Overview

**Conditional** **[logic](/help)** lets your forms adapt to respondents' answers. By default, forms follow a linear path with a next-page button. With page logic and conditional steps, you can control how pages connect, creating a more interactive and personalized experience.

## Edit page branching

To modify your form's flow, click `Logic`.

Let's say you want to go to different pages depending on the result of a respondent's input. For example, we'll ask respondents what kind of company they work at.

In this example, we want respondents to see different pages based on discount eligibility. With this, we’ll create two different **ending** pages (accepted and rejected). If they work at a non-profit, they'll also have to describe the organization.

What we want to do is:

- If they qualify for a discount right away (e.g. student), show them the accepted ending page
- If they work at a non-profit, show them the non-profit page
- If they don’t qualify (e.g. private company), show them the rejected ending page

First, click and drag from the `+` symbol on the right side of the page you want to connect, then drop it onto the target page. For example, we'll click the plus symbol on **Info** and route it to **Rejected**.

`Set condition` to define when it will redirect to **Rejected**. In this case, if it’s a **private company**.

Finally, we also want to route respondents to the success page right away if they’re a student. `+ Add branch` to `Set condition`.

We’re done! Now, respondents will get redirected to different pages depending on their answer.
