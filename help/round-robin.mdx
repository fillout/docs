## What is round robin scheduling

Round robin scheduling allocates appointments among hosts based on availability and priorities, ensuring each host gets equal opportunities and preventing any single host from being overloaded.

<Step title="Configure event details">

Set the **Title** and **Event duration**. You can also customize avatars or use a generic image such as a company logo for the event to maintain brand consistency in the `Booking page` from left-hand panel, or simply hover over it.

## Manage Priority and Availability

### Priority Settings

You can assign priority levels to participants to control the distribution of appointments. Higher priority members are more likely to receive bookings if multiple participants are available at the same time.

### Automatic Assignment

Filloutâ€™s round robin algorithm assigns appointments based on the last scheduled participant to ensure even distribution, provided all conditions of priority and availability are met.

### Adjusting Locations and Meeting Details

Define one **meeting location** or set specific locations or meeting settings for each participant. Choose between Google Meet, Zoom, and more.
