## How to add a section collapse field

This field is often used to group together questions if you have many questions in your form. Simply drag the `Section collapse` field onto your form.

</Frame>

You can also enable `Is collapsable` to allow the user to open or close a particular section. Click the field followed by the `settings icon` to toggle the switch on the right-hand panel.

</Frame>

This is how it would look like from your respondents' point of view.

## Conditionally hide many questions at once

If you set [conditional hiding](/help/conditional-hiding) logic on a section, all the questions in that section will be shown/hidden based on that logic.
