## Share your Fillout forms

Click the `Publish` button at the top-right of your form editor. Make sure your form is ready to go by trying it in `Preview` mode first!

<Frame>
<img src="/images/sharing-and-embedding/image-1.png"/>
</Frame>

Then, `Copy` the unique link to your form, or open it in a new tab `↗`.

You can also view your link at any time in the **Share** tab from the top menu.

### Embed Fillout forms on your website

Pick an embed option in the **Share** tab. You can embed it in four different ways:

- **Standard** \- a block embed on your site, which can be controlled in height and width
- **Full screen** \- an embed that takes up the entire screen
- **Popup** \- an embed in a large popup on screen, opens the form by pressing a button
- **Slider** \- in a sliding bar from either the left or the right side of the screen, opens the form by pressing a button

Click `Use this embed` and copy/paste the result into your website builder, or directly into your HTML code. That’s all! Your forms should be ready to go.
