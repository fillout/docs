## Overview

[Fillout Workflows](https://www.fillout.com/workflows) is the fastest way to build multi-step automations that trigger based on your Fillout forms and [schedulers](/help/how-to-create-scheduling-form). Get started with your first workflow [here](https://build.fillout.com/home/workflows).

Common use cases include automatic meeting reminders, follow-up emails, 3rd party app calls and more.

## How to create a workflow

Go to **Workflows** from the top menu to create a `+ Blank workflow`. Select which form you’d like to **apply the workflow to** in the dropdown menu. Then, choose a **trigger**.

</Frame>

Alternatively, you may open an existing form first or create a new one, then click **Integrate** on the top menu followed by `Workflows`.

**Workflow triggers**

A trigger refers to a condition that starts a specific action or series of actions. Examples are:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Form submitted" icon="square-check" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal={true}/>
  <Card title="Form abandoned" icon="cart-shopping" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal={true}/>
  <Card title="Scheduling event canceled" icon="calendar-day" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal={true}/>
  <Card title="Event rescheduled" icon="calendar-day" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal={true}/>
  <Card title="Before event starts (reminder emails)" icon="clock" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal={true}/>
</CardGroup>
Then, choose an **action** and `Edit` it according to your preferences. To add more actions, press the `+` icon.

**Workflow actions**

Actions are the tasks or steps that are automatically carried out after a trigger occurs. Examples are:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Run AI (Summarize, Classify, Generate, Extract)" href="/help/ai-workflows" icon="robot" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal={true}/>
  <Card title='Delay ("wait 4 hours")' href="/help/delay-workflows" icon="clock" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal={true}/>
  <Card title="Send custom emails" href="/help/custom-emails" icon="envelope-open-text" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal={true}/>
  <Card title="Filter and Branch" href="/help/filter-branch-workflows" icon="filter" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal={true}/>
  <Card title="Send Slack/Teams/Discord messages" icon="slack" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal={true}/>
  <Card title="Send Webhooks" icon="link" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal={true}/>
  <Card title="Connect to Zapier (coming soon)" icon="bolt" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal={true}/>
</CardGroup>

## Edit an existing workflow

Go to **Integrate** from the top menu of your form, and click `Workflows`. Select a workflow to edit it.

## Test workflows with prior submissions

Test your workflows without waiting for triggers or creating demo submissions.

## 1-click automations with templates

The fastest way to get started with workflows is from a [template](https://build.fillout.com/home/workflows). These are common use cases for Fillout Workflows.

## Monitor workflows in one place

Easily track email notifications and other workflows, with full visibility of what happened when. To view workflow runs, open your form and go to **Integrate** from the top menu. Click the `clock icon`.

<Frame>

</Frame>

You can also [view a single form submission](/help/view-responses#3adbe1475f90474fb6b76d367700bb55) and click on the `Workflows` tab. The workflow run history shows when each step occurred and if there were any issues.

**Good to know:** You can have as much as 5 different workflows in one form.
