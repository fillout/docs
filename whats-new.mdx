  ## ✨Home page 2.0, SDK, ClickUp integration, multiple fonts, invite links & more

  We spent the last few weeks overhauling the Fillout dashboard, adding integrations and a bunch of other goodies.

  Here's all that's new 👇

  #### 📂 Organize your forms

  Star and view recently opened forms on the home dashboard.

  Use drag and drop to move forms into workspaces and change workspace ordering. Right-click to rename, duplicate and more.

  #### 🏠 fillout.com redirects to home page

  Get to the home page dashboard faster when you're already logged in.

  #### 🗑️ Move to "Trash"

  Move forms to trash before deleting them. Permanently delete or restore a form in one click.

  ![2 Pn](/images/2.png)

  #### 🔒 Bulk close or delete forms

  Select multiple forms to open, close or delete.

  #### 🌎 Change form submission region in settings (Enterprise)

  Set your deployment region for form submission hosting and processing. Existing submissions are automatically migrated to your new region.

  #### 🖊️ Multiple custom font files

  Upload multiple files to better support bold, italic and other versions of your custom fonts.

  #### 🛠️ ClickUp integration

  Fillout now integrates natively with ClickUp.

  #### 📝 Add a note to a form

  Add a note to any form or scheduler from the home page dashboard. Notes are only visible to collaborators in your organization.

  #### 🔗 Collaborator invite link

  Share a secure invite link to easily add your team to Fillout. Optionally share invite links to only a specific workspace.

  ![5 Pn](/images/5.png)

  #### 🤖 TypeScript API SDK

  Use the new [Typescript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fillout/api) to interact with the Fillout API. Fetch submissions, forms and more with nicely typed functions.

  That's all for now\! Stay tuned for some big updates later this month 👀

  ## ✨Table field, edit history, asset gallery, form sharing & more

  We've shipped a ton already in 2025. Here's all that's new 👇

  #### 🔗 Easier collaboration

  Share a single form with a teammate with read or write permissions.

  Or, enable a magic link that grants access to a form or its results.

  #### 📝 Dynamically name generated PDF documents

  Based on form fields or any information in your forms.

  #### 📋 Table field

  Note: The table field can be connected to webhooks, Zapier and Make (native integrations coming soon\!).

  #### 🧰 Delete submissions via API

  Delete form responses with the new [REST API endpoint](https://www.fillout.com/help/fillout-rest-api#561f294d7c17464e9b53fa1ca78c9ecf).

  #### 🚀 Edit history

  Views changes made to your forms and scheduling links.

  Plus, see who connected which 3rd party apps in admin settings.

  #### 👀 Conditionally render PDF fields

  Add fields to a PDF only if they meet a certain condition.

  #### 🖼️ Organization asset gallery

  Easily reuse images across your forms, like logos or media assets.
