<Update label="April 2025">
  ## New in Fillout ✨Home page 2.0, SDK, ClickUp integration, multiple fonts, invite links & more

  We spent the last few weeks overhauling the Fillout dashboard, adding integrations and a bunch of other goodies.

  Here's all that's new 👇

  #### 📂 Organize your forms

  Star and view recently opened forms on the home dashboard.

  Use drag and drop to move forms into workspaces and change workspace ordering. Right-click to rename, duplicate and more.

  #### 🏠 fillout.com redirects to home page

  Get to the home page dashboard faster when you're already logged in.

  #### 🗑️ Move to "Trash"

  Move forms to trash before deleting them. Permanently delete or restore a form in one click.

  #### 🔒 Bulk close or delete forms

  Select multiple forms to open, close or delete.

  #### 🌎 Change form submission region in settings (Enterprise)

  Set your deployment region for form submission hosting and processing. Existing submissions are automatically migrated to your new region.

  #### 🖊️ Multiple custom font files

  Upload multiple files to better support bold, italic and other versions of your custom fonts.

  #### 🛠️ ClickUp integration

  Fillout now integrates natively with ClickUp.

  #### 📝 Add a note to a form

  Add a note to any form or scheduler from the home page dashboard. Notes are only visible to collaborators in your organization.

  #### 🔗 Collaborator invite link

  Share a secure invite link to easily add your team to Fillout. Optionally share invite links to only a specific workspace.

  #### 🤖 TypeScript API SDK

  Use the new Typescript SDK to interact with the Fillout API. Fetch submissions, forms and more with nicely typed functions.

  That's all for now\! Stay tuned for some big updates later this month 👀

<Update label="March 2025">
  ## New in Fillout ✨Table field, edit history, asset gallery, form sharing & more

  We've shipped a ton already in 2025. Here's all that's new 👇

  #### 🔗 Easier collaboration

  Share a single form with a teammate with read or write permissions.

  Or, enable a magic link that grants access to a form or its results.

  #### 📝 Dynamically name generated PDF documents

  Based on form fields or any information in your forms.

  #### 📋 Table field

  Collect multiple rows of data with the new table field. Let respondents specify how many items they want to add.

  Note: The table field can be connected to webhooks, Zapier and Make (native integrations coming soon\!).

  #### 🧰 Delete submissions via API

  Delete form responses with the new REST API endpoint.

  #### 🚀 Edit history

  Views changes made to your forms and scheduling links.

  Plus, see who connected which 3rd party apps in admin settings.
