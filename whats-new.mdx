  #### 📞 Zoom, Google Meet & custom locations

  Fillout Scheduling integrates with Google Meet and Zoom. Alternatively, set a custom location or ask prospects for their phone number.

  Choose which days and times you'd like to accept meetings.

  Today we released major upgrades to Fillout's developer features and tools to manage 3rd party integrations.

  #### 🤖 REST API is now free

  The Fillout [REST API](https://www.fillout.com/help/fillout-rest-api) lets you access your form responses programmatically, without using the Fillout site.

  It's now available on all plans, including the free tier.

  Return responses before/after a certain date, fetch in progress submissions, sort responses and even obtain an edit link for any form submission.

  We've also improved the response format to make it easier to work with.

  #### 🔒 Restrict integrations by workspace (Enterprise)

  Limit who in your organization can access each of your 3rd party accounts. Set permission boundaries across teams or different clients.

  #### 🔄 Build 3rd party apps (OAuth)

  Create apps that integrate with Fillout accounts.

  Third party apps let you or your users access Fillout responses via API. Once someone grants access to your application, you'll have API access to fetch forms, responses and even create webhooks. Learn more here.

  ## Launch Week Day 2 ✨ Subforms and Submission Pickers

  Welcome to Day 2 of Fillout [Launch Week](https://www.fillout.com/blog/launch-week-ii).

  Today we're introducing two powerful new field types to Fillout: the Subform and Submission picker.

  These advanced fields enable a new set of data collection use cases.

  #### 🔍 Subform

  [Subforms](https://www.fillout.com/help/subforms) make it easy to collect repeated information in your forms.

  For example, say you need your users to tell you about each of their family members.

  With a subform, respondents can add as many family members as they need. Each entry opens its own [customizable Fillout form](https://www.fillout.com/blog/launch-week-ii).

  ![Screenshot2025 04 23at4 18 26PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at4.18.26PM.png)

  The subform also lets users [edit and resume](https://www.fillout.com/blog/launch-week-ii) in-progress submissions.

  #### ✅ Validation options

  Limit the number of subform responses your users can add with validation settings.

  ![Screenshot2025 04 23at4 18 38PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at4.18.38PM.png)

  #### **🔄 Submission picker field**

  This field lets respondents [select from previous submissions](https://www.fillout.com/help/submission-picker) of any Fillout form, without the need for a 3rd party integration.

  You can even use the selected submission to pre-fill fields or dynamically show/hide parts of your form.

  ![Screenshot2025 04 23at4 18 45PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at4.18.45PM.png)

  #### 👀 Filter which submissions are visible

  Lastly, set filters that determine which submissions a user can choose from.

  For example, only allow users to select their own past form submissions by matching on their login email.

  That's all for today\! Stay tuned for the next Launch Week update tomorrow on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fillout) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/filloutcom).

  If your respondents submit multiple Fillout forms, they'll only need to verify their email on their first submission.

  #### 📝 Let users edit past submissions

  Enable editing past submissions to let your users see and update any of their prior responses, even across devices.

  ![Screenshot2025 04 23at4 15 23PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at4.15.23PM.png)

  #### 🔐 Single Sign-On (Enterprise)

  Add Microsoft, OneLogin, Google Workspaces, Okta and other types of SSO login to your form. Optionally pre-fill fields with custom SSO attributes. Learn more [here](https://www.fillout.com/help/sso-form-login).

  #### ✅ Limit submissions to specific domains

  For internal-facing forms, limit submissions to only your company domain.

  ## New in Fillout ✨ The Conversion Kit

  We're particularly excited to share today's Fillout update for two reasons:

  1. These features are **brand new to the world of form builders**.
  2. Our team's been working on this for several months. We've been beta-testing on our own forms and have seen _really good results_.

  Introducing the [Fillout Conversion Kit](https://www.fillout.com/conversion-kit).

  #### What is it?

  In short, the Conversion Kit helps optimize your forms and reduce drop-offs. It's particularly well suited for lead generation.

  Because **Fillout covers the costs** for external services like Clearbit and Google Maps, the Conversion Kit is an **optional paid add-on** to Fillout.

  Ok... but what does it do?

  #### 📆 Enrich and route leads

  Enable enrichment to automatically gather industry, company size, revenue, role and more for each respondent.

  Based on this data, you can intelligently qualify, score and route leads **within the form itself**.

  #### 🛟 Recover lost leads

  Inevitably, some people will start your forms and leave halfway through. Now, you can:

  Notify your team whenever a prospect drops off.

  Send a custom **abandoned form email** encouraging people to resume their submission.

  ![3 Web](/images/3.webp)

  #### 📩 Better data with smart email validation

  Enforce valid addresses or company-only emails to improve data quality.

  #### 🔎 Boost conversion with autocomplete

  Autofill addresses, company size, industry, role and more to reduce friction.

  Use dynamic form shortening to automatically hide known fields. **Fewer questions = more conversions**.

  ![4 Gi](/images/4.gif)

  #### 💼 Optimize ad campaigns (Coming soon)

  Send conversion events to LinkedIn, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter and Google Ads to optimize your campaigns.

  ![5 Pn](/images/5.png)

  ## Fillout Launch Week Day 4 ✨ Import your Google Forms

  Welcome to Day 4 of Fillout Launch Week.

  Today's launch is a bit different. Instead of adding new features, we wanted to make it easier to get started with Fillout in the first place.

  Introducing the [Google Form Importer](https://www.fillout.com/google-forms-customizer).

  ![15 Pn](/images/15.png)

  You've almost certainly heard of Google Forms - it's the most popular form builder with over 1 billion users. Our new tool makes it quick and easy to import an existing Google Form into Fillout.

  #### 👉 Getting started

  First, connect your Google Forms account and choose the form you want to import.

  That's it\! If you don't have a Fillout account, you don't even need to sign up to see the end result.

  We also made specific pages for features that Fillout supports that Google Forms does not, like [adding a signature field](https://www.fillout.com/google-forms-customizer/add-signature-to-google-form), [protecting your form with CAPTCHA](https://www.fillout.com/google-forms-customizer/add-captcha-to-google-forms), [accepting payments](https://www.fillout.com/google-forms-customizer/accept-payments-on-google-forms) and 17 others.![16 Pn](/images/16.png)

  ## Fillout Launch Week Day 3 ✨ Fully customized links

  Welcome to Day 3 of Fillout [Launch Week](https://www.fillout.com/blog/launch-week).

  Today, we're introducing a way to fully customize your form links - for free\!

  #### 🔗 Choose a share link "subdomain"

  By default, Fillout form links look like "_forms.fillout.com/t/sKWfR8LJnous_".

  That works if you're embedding the form or sharing it internally.

  But if you're sharing the link with clients or prospects, you'll want to make the link look on-brand.

  ![17 Pn](/images/17.png)

  Starting today, you can choose a pretty URL, like "[mybrand.fillout.com](http://mybrand.fillout.com)", even on the free plan.

  If you want a fully white-labelled link, connect your own [custom domain](https://www.fillout.com/help/custom-domains) on the business tier.

  #### 🎨 Custom endings

  Once you've chosen a subdomain or connected a custom domain, you can choose a "custom ending" for any form.

  For example, you might make the URL of a holiday RSVP form end with "holiday-event".

  ![18 Pn](/images/18.png)

  If you want to customize the link preview that appears when sharing a link on social media, you can [do that too](https://www.fillout.com/help/customize-form-share-link).

  ## Launch Week Day 2 ✨ A new way to send forms and track submissions

  Welcome to Day 2 of Fillout [Launch Week](https://www.fillout.com/blog/launch-week).

  Today, we're introducing a new way to share and track your Fillout forms.

  #### 📭 Request form submission by email

  Say you need to collect event RSVPs from everyone on your team.

  From the Fillout "share" tab, just press **Send by email**. You can customize the email message and who it goes out to.

  ![19 Pn](/images/19.png)

  Your respondents will receive a formatted email, based on your form's theme.

  They can come back to the form at **any time and from any device**.

  ![20 Pn](/images/20.png)

  #### 📦 Track completions

  Each form is automatically linked to the person it was sent to.

  You'll know which response belongs to whom and who still needs to complete the form - no need to ask for an email address.

  ![21 Pn](/images/21.png)

  #### 📆 Automatic reminders (coming soon)

  If you need the form filled out by a certain day, set a deadline and enable automatic reminders. Reminders will go out to those who haven't completed the form ahead of the deadline.

  #### ⚡️ Automate workflows with Zapier

  You can also trigger a form to send from [Zapier](https://www.fillout.com/help/zapier). For example, send a feedback form when a customer unsubscribes from your service.
